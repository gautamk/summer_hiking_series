# Summer Hiking Guide 2026

**Season:** June 20 - September 19, 2026 (14 weekends)

Summer is when the mountains open up. Alpine meadows bloom with wildflowers, lakes turn turquoise, and the long daylight hours let you push further. This is the season for the big trips to Mt. Rainier, Mt. Baker, and the North Cascades, balanced with closer I-90 corridor hikes for less demanding weekends.

## Season at a Glance

See [../data/summer_hikes.csv](../data/summer_hikes.csv) for full trail data and [../data/master_schedule.csv](../data/master_schedule.csv) for the week-by-week plan.

## Early Summer (June 20 - July 11)

Snow is melting fast. Alpine lakes in the I-90 corridor open first. Higher passes and Mt. Rainier roads open in early July.

**Week 14 — June 20: Snow Lake** (Snoqualmie Pass, 7.2 mi, moderate). The most-hiked alpine lake in Washington, and for good reason. Crystal-clear teal water surrounded by jagged peaks. Go mid-week or arrive by 7 AM on weekends. Alpine Lakes Wilderness permit required May 15 - Oct 31.

**Week 15 — June 27: Annette Lake** (Snoqualmie Pass, 7.5 mi, moderate). A quieter alternative to Snow Lake with wildflower meadows and a waterfall along the way. Good swimming by late June. Northwest Forest Pass required.

**Week 16 — July 4: Naches Peak Loop** (Mt. Rainier / Chinook Pass, 3.5 mi, easy). A holiday weekend trip worth the 2.5-hour drive. This gentle alpine loop puts you face to face with Mt. Rainier through wildflower meadows with almost no effort. Hike counterclockwise for the best Rainier views.

> **Overnight:** Enumclaw is about 40 minutes from the trailhead. Affordable motels and restaurants make it a good base for a long weekend.

**Week 17 — July 11: Melakwa Lake** (Snoqualmie Pass, 8.5 mi, hard). A teal alpine lake reached by passing the Denny Creek waterslide and Keekwulee Falls. 2,700 feet of elevation gain makes this the steepest I-90 hike in the schedule. More secluded than Snow Lake and great for swimming. Bring lunch and stay a while.

## Peak Summer (July 18 - August 22)

This is it. Wildflower meadows at their peak, the longest days, the warmest temperatures. The schedule swings between big destination hikes and closer options. Start early on alpine trails to beat afternoon thunderstorms.

**Week 18 — July 18: Skyline Trail Loop** (Mt. Rainier / Paradise, 5.5 mi, moderate). The most popular trail on Rainier during peak wildflower season (late July to early August). Glacier views, subalpine meadows, and waterfalls. The parking lot fills by 8 AM on weekends, so arrive at sunrise or go mid-week.

> **Overnight:** Ashford is 20 minutes from the Nisqually entrance. Lodges, cabins, and restaurants cater to park visitors.

**Week 19 — July 25: Yellow Aster Butte** (Mt. Baker, 7.5 mi, hard). A 2-hour drive to one of the most spectacular wildflower displays in Washington. Lupine, paintbrush, and heather carpet the meadows with 360-degree views of Baker and Shuksan. Start early to get off the summit before afternoon thunderstorms.

> **Overnight:** Bellingham (45 minutes from the trailhead) or the tiny town of Glacier for a more rustic stay.

**Week 20 — August 1: Spray Park** (Mt. Rainier / Mowich Lake, 8.0 mi, moderate/hard). The quiet side of Rainier. Alpine meadows, waterfalls, and far fewer people than Paradise. The road to Mowich Lake is unpaved and only open July through mid-October. Dogs not allowed.

> **Overnight:** Ashford again, or Enumclaw if approaching from the north.

**Week 21 — August 8: Colchuck Lake** (Leavenworth, 8.0 mi, moderate/hard). The gateway to the Enchantments. Turquoise water beneath the towering walls of Dragontail Peak and Colchuck Peak. Day hiking does not require an overnight permit, but arrive very early as the lot fills fast. Dogs not allowed in the Alpine Lakes core zone.

> **Overnight:** Leavenworth is 30 minutes from the trailhead. Bavarian-themed downtown with excellent restaurants and breweries. Worth a Saturday night stay.

**Week 22 — August 15: Lake Ann** (Mt. Baker, 8.7 mi, hard). Close-up views of Mt. Shuksan's west face and glaciers. Alpine meadows bloom through August. Snow can linger into late summer on the upper trail.

> **Overnight:** Bellingham or Glacier.

**Week 23 — August 22: Blue Lake** (North Cascades / Hwy 20, 4.4 mi, moderate). A vivid turquoise alpine lake at 6,254 feet under the granite spires of Liberty Bell and Early Winters. A moderate hike with huge scenery. Mosquitoes can be heavy in mid-summer, so bring repellent.

> **Overnight:** Winthrop, a Western-themed town about 30 minutes east on Highway 20. Great food and a fun atmosphere.

## Late Summer (August 29 - September 19)

The big alpine trips wind down and the schedule returns closer to home. Days are still warm but shorter. This is the calm before larch season.

**Week 24 — August 29: Mount Pilchuck** (Mountain Loop Hwy, 5.4 mi, moderate). A historic fire lookout at the summit with panoramic views of Baker, Rainier, and the Olympics. One of the best lookout hikes near Seattle, and just an hour's drive.

**Week 25 — September 5: Glacier Basin** (Mt. Rainier / Sunrise, 7.0 mi, moderate). A Labor Day trip to the biggest glacier on Rainier. The Emmons Glacier viewpoint sits in an alpine basin with marmots, wildflowers (late bloom), and dramatic ice.

> **Overnight:** Enumclaw for the long weekend.

**Week 26 — September 12: West Tiger 3** (Issaquah, 6.2 mi, moderate). Back close to home. A solid climb through Tiger Mountain State Forest with panoramic views of Seattle, Lake Washington, and Rainier on clear days.

**Week 27 — September 19: Mirror Lake** (Snoqualmie Pass, 3.0 mi, moderate). A quiet end to summer. This small alpine lake sees few visitors compared to nearby Snow Lake and Annette Lake. Peaceful reflection views of the surrounding peaks.

## What to Bring

Sunscreen, plenty of water (alpine trails have limited shade), and layers for morning starts. Bug spray is essential July through August, especially near lakes. For the Mt. Rainier and Mt. Baker trips, bring a warm layer even in August since alpine temperatures drop fast.

## Passes Needed

Mt. Rainier requires a National Park entry fee ($35/vehicle for 7 days). Most other trails need a Northwest Forest Pass ($30/year). The America the Beautiful Pass ($80/year) covers all federal lands and is the best deal if you're hiking regularly.
