# Fall Hiking Guide 2026

**Season:** September 22 - December 19, 2026 (13 weekends)

Fall in the PNW comes in two acts. First, the golden larches in early October draw hikers to the eastern Cascades for some of the most photogenic trails in Washington. Then, as rain returns and snow pushes hikers back to lower elevations, waterfalls come alive again and the forests turn to deep greens and autumn colors. The season ends with quiet winter walks close to home.

## Season at a Glance

See [../data/fall_hikes.csv](../data/fall_hikes.csv) for full trail data and [../data/master_schedule.csv](../data/master_schedule.csv) for the week-by-week plan.

## Larch Season (September 26 - October 17)

The first four weekends of fall are devoted to golden larches, the deciduous conifers that turn brilliant gold in early October before dropping their needles. These are further from Seattle but absolutely worth the drive.

**Week 28 — September 26: Cutthroat Lake** (North Cascades / Hwy 20, 3.8 mi, easy/moderate). The easiest larch hike in Washington. A gentle walk through forest to a lake ringed by larches just starting to turn. This is a good warm-up for the bigger larch hikes ahead, and kid-friendly.

> **Overnight:** Winthrop (30 minutes east on Hwy 20). The 2.5-hour drive each way makes a Saturday night stay worthwhile. Winthrop has excellent restaurants and a quirky Western-town atmosphere.

**Week 29 — October 3: Lake Ingalls** (Alpine Lakes / Teanaway, 9.0 mi, hard). The iconic larch hike. A strenuous 2,500-foot climb to a basin surrounded by golden larches, rocky peaks, mountain goats, and views of Mt. Stuart and the Esmeralda Peaks. This is peak larch viewing, and it will be crowded. Arrive extremely early. The parking lot fills by 7 AM.

> **Overnight:** Leavenworth (about an hour from the trailhead). This is a solid two-day trip: drive Friday evening, hike Saturday, explore Leavenworth Sunday.

**Week 30 — October 10: Colchuck Lake** (Leavenworth, 8.0 mi, moderate/hard). The same trail hiked in August, now transformed. Dragontail Peak towers above turquoise water framed by golden larches. Fall colors at Colchuck are among the most photographed scenes in Washington.

> **Overnight:** Leavenworth again.

**Week 31 — October 17: Blue Lake** (North Cascades / Hwy 20, 4.4 mi, moderate). Golden larch forest reflected in crystal-clear blue water under granite spires. A moderate hike with outsized scenery. Note that Highway 20 typically closes for winter sometime in November, so this may be one of the last chances to visit.

> **Overnight:** Winthrop or Mazama (both nearby on Hwy 20).

## Fall Foliage and Waterfalls (October 24 - November 28)

The larches are done, the rain is back, and the focus shifts to lower-elevation trails close to Seattle. Waterfalls are recharging, vine maples turn red, and the forests take on that moody PNW character.

**Week 32 — October 24: Snow Lake** (Snoqualmie Pass, 7.0 mi, moderate). A familiar trail in a new season. Vine maples and berry bushes lining the trail turn bright red in late October. The lake is quieter now, with far fewer hikers than summer.

**Week 33 — October 31: Rattlesnake Ledge** (North Bend, 4.0 mi, moderate). Halloween hike with fall foliage over the Cedar River Watershed. The maples and alders along the trail are at peak color, and the views from the ledge are dramatic in moody autumn light.

**Week 34 — November 7: Wallace Falls** (Gold Bar, 5.6 mi, moderate). November rain means the three-tiered cascade is back at full power. The trail along the Wallace River is lush and green, and the falls are spectacular when fed by autumn storms.

**Week 35 — November 14: Twin Falls** (North Bend, 2.4 mi, easy/moderate). A return visit from April, and the trio of cascades are pumping again with fall rain. The forest is darker, mossier, and the trail has a moody atmosphere that's completely different from spring.

**Week 36 — November 21: Snoqualmie Falls** (Snoqualmie, 1.4 mi, easy). Thanksgiving week. A short, easy visit to the thundering falls. November is peak flow month and the mist rises hundreds of feet. Accessible for visiting family and guests.

**Week 37 — November 28: Coal Creek Falls** (Issaquah, 2.2 mi, moderate). Post-Thanksgiving walk. The falls are flowing again after summer dormancy. The forest floor is covered in mushrooms and fallen leaves. Just 25 minutes from downtown.

## Winter Approach (December 5 - December 19)

The final three weekends close the series with a mix of one last moderate hike and two easy walks as daylight shrinks and weather gets more unpredictable.

**Week 38 — December 5: Goat Lake** (Mountain Loop Hwy, 10.4 mi, moderate/hard). The longest hike of the fall schedule. Late-season color along Elliot Creek, with the lake sitting in a dramatic cirque. Check road conditions on the Mountain Loop Highway, as closures are common by December.

**Week 39 — December 12: Franklin Falls** (Snoqualmie Pass, 2.0 mi, easy). A winter waterfall walk. Snow may dust the forest and the falls are beautiful framed by ice and dark rock. Short and sweet for the shorter December days.

**Week 40 — December 19: Rattlesnake Lake** (North Bend, 1.3 mi, easy). Winter solstice eve. A flat loop around the lake to close out the series where it effectively began, in the Snoqualmie Valley. Quiet, reflective, and a fitting end to 40 weekends of hiking.

## What to Bring

Rain gear is non-negotiable from October onward. Waterproof boots, rain jacket, and rain pants. For larch hikes in early October, bring warm layers as temperatures at elevation can drop to freezing. A headlamp is essential starting in November as sunset comes as early as 4:30 PM. Microspikes for the larch hikes if there has been early snow.

## Passes Needed

Larch hikes require a Northwest Forest Pass ($30/year). Wallace Falls requires a Discover Pass ($35/year). Most other fall trails are free or covered by existing passes.
