# Spring Hiking Guide 2026

**Season:** March 20 - June 19, 2026 (13 weekends)

Spring in the Pacific Northwest is waterfall season. Snowmelt and rain push cascades to their peak volume while lower-elevation forests explode with wildflowers, ferns, and mossy green canopies. The schedule starts easy and builds through the season as trails at higher elevations shed their snow.

## Season at a Glance

See [../data/spring_hikes.csv](../data/spring_hikes.csv) for full trail data and [../data/master_schedule.csv](../data/master_schedule.csv) for the week-by-week plan.

## Early Spring (March 21 - April 25)

The first five weekends stick close to Seattle with low-elevation trails that are snow-free year-round. This is prime waterfall viewing, so trails along rivers and creeks are the focus.

**Week 1 — March 21: Green Lake Loop** (Seattle, 2.8 mi, easy). A gentle season opener right in the city. Cherry blossoms line the lake in late March and early April. Walk, jog, or just enjoy being outside again.

**Week 2 — March 28: Snoqualmie Falls** (Snoqualmie, 1.4 mi, easy). The 268-foot falls thunder with spring snowmelt. Paved viewpoints make this accessible for anyone. Combine with a stop in downtown Snoqualmie for coffee.

**Week 3 — April 4: Twin Falls** (North Bend, 2.4 mi, easy/moderate). The first real trail of the series. A trio of cascades through mossy old growth, all pumping hard with spring runoff. The South Fork Snoqualmie River is beautiful in April. Discover Pass required.

**Week 4 — April 11: Coal Creek Falls** (Issaquah, 2.2 mi, moderate). A hidden waterfall on Cougar Mountain, just 25 minutes from downtown. This 28-foot falls runs dry by summer, so spring is the time to see it. Good mushroom spotting on the forest floor.

**Week 5 — April 18: Little Si** (North Bend, 3.7 mi, moderate). The first climb of the series, gaining 1,300 feet to a rocky bluff with views of the Snoqualmie Valley. Less crowded than its big sibling Mt. Si, and spring wildflowers dot the trail. Has a Boulder Garden Loop option for variety. Discover Pass required.

**Week 6 — April 25: Rattlesnake Ledge** (North Bend, 4.0 mi, moderate). One of the most popular hikes near Seattle for good reason. Well-engineered switchbacks lead to a ledge overlooking Rattlesnake Lake, Chester Morse Lake, Mt. Si, and Mt. Washington. No pass required. Arrive before 8 AM on weekends.

## Mid Spring (May 2 - May 23)

May brings peak wildflower bloom at lower elevations and the best waterfall viewing of the year. Trails get a bit longer and further from the city.

**Week 7 — May 2: Franklin Falls** (Snoqualmie Pass, 2.0 mi, easy). A short walk through old growth forest to a falls you can feel misting your face. Peak flow in May makes this unforgettable. Family-friendly and just off I-90.

**Week 8 — May 9: Poo Poo Point** (Issaquah, 4.0 mi, moderate). Climb through spring wildflowers and ferns to the paraglider launch on Tiger Mountain. Watch the gliders launch while you eat lunch with views of Lake Sammamish and Mt. Rainier.

**Week 9 — May 16: Teneriffe Falls** (North Bend, 5.6 mi, moderate). Twenty-two switchbacks climb to a waterfall running at full volume. The final 0.9 miles gains 850 feet, so bring your legs. Discover Pass required.

**Week 10 — May 23: Wallace Falls** (Gold Bar, 5.6 mi, moderate). Worth the hour drive on Highway 2. Nine waterfalls total, including the three-tiered main cascade, all fed by peak snowmelt. The Woody Trail winds along the Wallace River with panoramic Skykomish River valley views from the Middle Falls overlook. Discover Pass required.

## Late Spring (May 30 - June 13)

Higher-elevation trails start opening. Alpine lakes emerge from snow and the Mountain Loop Highway becomes accessible.

**Week 11 — May 30: Lake 22** (Granite Falls, 5.4 mi, moderate). The first alpine lake of the series, sitting at the base of Mt. Pilchuck. Waterfalls line the trail as snowmelt feeds Twenty-Two Creek. A preview of the summer lake hikes to come.

**Week 12 — June 6: Lake Serene and Bridal Veil Falls** (Stevens Pass, 8.2 mi, moderate/hard). The biggest day of spring: a 2,000-foot climb to a stunning alpine lake beneath the 3,000-foot cliff face of Mt. Index, with a side trip to Bridal Veil Falls at peak flow. The final 1.5 miles gain 1,300 feet, so start very early. Northwest Forest Pass required.

**Week 13 — June 13: Heather Lake** (Granite Falls, 4.4 mi, moderate). A subalpine lake tucked into the slopes of Mt. Pilchuck. Bright yellow skunk cabbage blooms in the marshy areas and the forest is thick with spring green. Bring waterproof boots for the rooty, muddy sections.

## What to Bring

Spring in the PNW means layers and rain gear, always. Even on sunny forecasts, bring a rain jacket and an extra layer. Trails can be muddy, so waterproof boots are a good idea from March through May. Trekking poles help on the steeper trails (Teneriffe Falls, Lake Serene).

## Passes Needed

Most spring trails in this schedule need a Discover Pass ($35/year) or are free. Wallace Falls is a State Park (Discover Pass). Franklin Falls and Lake 22 are National Forest (Northwest Forest Pass, $30/year or $5/day).
